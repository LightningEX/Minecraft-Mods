# Welcome to the Minecraft Mod Hub!
This is another part of the Gamer Hub repository, created to host a site for console users (specifically Xbox) to download mods for Minecraft. 

Microsoft has, on multiple occasions, restricted its users' ability to mod games. This website provides an easy way for users to get the mods they want! Message me on Discord for any mods you'd like to see added, and I'll go over them! 

In the meantime, enjoy your new experiences with Minecraft! Check back here frequently, as I constantly update and adjust mods!

# Change Log:
- Updated Minecraft Essentials to v2.20.3
- Created a webhook for administrative and moderation purposes
